# Notes:
# <c-n> <c-p> to select completions
# FIFO buffer for REPL
# | to send to command

# Questions
# - How do I cancel a selection?
# - How can I get alt-arrows to do what I want?
# - How do I move between matching things

# This is a long test string that I will try to use with fold to see if it works.
