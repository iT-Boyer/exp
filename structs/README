OpenGL code has to use cstructs heavily for preparing shader
data. Unfortunately, cstructs in Racket are very very slow. This
micro-benchmark computes how slow and is a record of some experiments
to go faster.

* One strange thing to note... the `c` version has just as many checks
  as the `struct-w/-contract` version, because all C FFI functions use
  contracts to verify their inputs. It seems very strange that going
  across the FFI border is better than not in this case.

* Why the improvment?

`define-cstruct` and `define-cpointer-type` (which it uses) expand to
something like:

```
(define-values (a b c d)
 (let ()
  ....
  (define a ....)
  (define b ....)
  (define c ....)
  (define d ....)
  ....
  (values a b c d)))
```

This inhibits the inliner because the definitions of a-d are not
visible. My patch undoes that

* What is more to do?

I got things ready to expose unsafe cstruct accessors that don't check
the tag. These rely on knowing the offset. Exposing the offset would
also be useful for code like OpenGL shaders where you must specify VAO
layouts. I think we should do both.

If you compare the expansion of 'cstruct and 'unsafe-cstruct (in the
inlined case), you'll see that 'cstruct is bogged down by checking
that the result of `make-cs` has the `cs-tag`, which is unfortunate
because it definitely does. It would be good to improve the compiler
to be able to track that.

I do not know if the JIT is inlining `ptr-ref`/`ptr-set!`, but it
appears to have difficulty (based on a comparison between the 'ptr
version and the 'unsafe-flvector version)

I don't believe there are any other obvious problems with
`define-cstruct`'s expansion.

I think the things to do are to invest in having the
compiler/optimizer be able to improve pointer operations to not need
the runtime information in the type so that it can produce "lowered"
forms that can be jitted without boxing the structure member.

Another idea is to make a new `define-cstruct`-like macro that uses a
combination of homogenuous vector types and casting to get and set
((i8/16/32/64)|(f32/64)) values.
