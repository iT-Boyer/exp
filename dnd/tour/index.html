  <h1>D&amp;D 4th Edition on your iPhone</h1>
  <h3>by Jay McCarthy on 2008/06/10</h3>

  <p>In the past week, two amazing products came on my radar. First,
  the new 4th edition
  of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome"><cite>Dungeons
  and Dragons</cite></a> was released
  by <a href="http://www.wizards.com/">Wizards of the
  Coast</a>. Second, the
  new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 3G</a> was
  announced. I thought, why not have these two great things
  together?</p>

  <p>Part of the new D&amp;D effort
  is <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/insider"><cite>Dungeons
  and Dragons Insider</cite></a> (DDI), a way of enabling a more
  digital and enhanced experience on the tabletop. I'm very excited
  about
  the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/insider/characterbuilder"><cite>Character
  Builder</cite></a> that helps when designing a D&amp;D
  character. Unfortunately, the <cite>Builder</cite> is only
  advertised to produce a nice character sheet for the table.</p>

  <p>While thinking about this Sunday (2008/06/08), I read a post
  from <a href="http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=1042707">Ken
  Tropp</a>, the executive producer of DDI, and put in my request for
  an iPhone interface. After the Sabbath, on Monday (2008/06/09), I
  decided to do something about it and make my own.</p>

  <p>Let me take you on a tour. (Click on any image for a
  zoom-in.)</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Home.png"><img src="thmb-Home.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>On the top, we have the name of the character and the 'Status'
  button, with the current HP. Each of the links goes to a different
  section of the character sheet.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Stats.png"><img src="thmb-Stats.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>The first link goes to the basic statistics about the
  character. One thing to notice at this point is that this is meant
  to be a character sheet <em>viewer</em> and combat supplement. I
  didn't design it to be the sheet where you, e.g., calculate where
  modifiers come from, etc.</p>

  <p>Notice that we can go back to the main page on the upper left and
  that the Status button is always there on the upper right.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Features.png"><img src="thmb-Features.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>The second link is the features view, where you can record
  free-form information about the race, class, paragon, etc. features
  of a character.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Skills.png"><img src="thmb-Skills.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>The third link is the skills view. Every skill, with its core
  ability and modifier is listed. (Again, it does not say where these
  come from. In Kugo's case, this might be relevant, because he uses a
  shield which gives Check penalties.) One nice thing about this view
  is that Insight and Perception on "above the fold", so you can
  easily get their Passive values.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Feats.png"><img src="thmb-Feats.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>The fourth link down is the feats list. When you click on a feat,
  you can view that feat's details:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Feat Details.png"><img src="thmb-Feat Details.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>Let's skip down to the sixth link, before looking at Powers and
  the Status button.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Inventory.png"><img src="thmb-Inventory.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>Sixth is the Inventory view. Currently, a simple text area. I
  haven't played long enough to know what capabilities this part
  should have.</p>

  <p>The coolest part of the sheet is the Powers and Status
  section.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Powers - Initial.png"><img src="thmb-Powers - Initial.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>Your powers are divided up into At-will, Encounter, and Daily
  sections. Clicking on any power will bring up its card.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Power - At-will.png"><img src="thmb-Power - At-will.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>Here's the <cite>Sure Strike</cite> At-will power.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Power - Encounter.png"><img src="thmb-Power - Encounter.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>An encounter power looks similar, except there is a 'Spend'
  button that lets you mark the power as spent. Suppose we do
  so...</p>

  <p>When we go back to the Powers view, the power is marked:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Powers - Encounter.png"><img src="thmb-Powers - Encounter.jpg" /></a></p>
  
  <p>Let's look at a daily power and do the same thing.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Power - Daily.png"><img src="thmb-Power - Daily.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>After we click it, maybe we accidentally click it again, either
  now or later in the encounter/day. The sheet will display a little
  error:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Power - Daily Twice.png"><img src="thmb-Power - Daily Twice.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>When we click anywhere, the error goes away and we can return to
  the Powers view.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Powers - Encounter and Daily.png"><img src="thmb-Powers - Encounter and Daily.jpg" /></a></p>
  
  <p>Now, let's look at the Status view by clicking the button on the
  upper right.</p>
  
  <p align="center"><a href="Status.png"><img src="thmb-Status.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>The display shows the character's defenses and HP. Since the
  button is always there, these are easily accessible during
  play.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the Status view are two buttons:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Status - Bottom.png"><img src="thmb-Status - Bottom.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>We will get to the buttons in a moment. Suppose we need to
    record damage, we just click on the HP field and type in a new
    value.</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Status - Bloodied.png"><img src="thmb-Status - Bloodied.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>If the new value is less than half the max, then the character is
  bloodied and the Status button changes from Blue to Red.</p>

  <p>If our character takes a Short Rest, then we can click the left
  button at the bottom of the Status view. This won't update our HP,
  but it does restore our encounter powers:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Powers - Daily.png"><img src="thmb-Powers - Daily.jpg" /></a></p>

  <p>Similarly, if we were to click the Extended Rest button, then our
  HP, Surges, Action points, Encounter, and Daily powers are all
  restored:</p>

  <p align="center"><a href="Powers - Initial.png"><img src="thmb-Powers - Initial.jpg" /></a></p>

  <h2>More Details</h2>

  <p>The application is not tied to any database, so everything must
  be typed in manually, although there is a lot of structure to the
  code, so it is pretty simple for an amateur to deal with
  it. Ideally, I'd like to make something that exports a custom sheet
  from some other program, such as the <cite>Character Builder</cite>
  or something else.</p>

  <p>The application is a single HTML page. This is useful because
  there is literally no lag when looking at the different parts of the
  sheet. One side-effect of this is that the sheet has no memory. If
  you press Refresh, then the HP, power usage, etc. is reset.</p>

  <p>I wrote this in one day
  using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">Joe Hewitt's iUI
  library</a>, the <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax
  language</a>,
  the <a href="http://marketcircle.com/iphoney/">iPhoney</a> iPhone
  simulator, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU
  Emacs</a>.</p>
