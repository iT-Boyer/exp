The main idea of this is to be a DVORAK keyboard with a custom
fourth-row.

On the Atreus, the thumbs rest below X and B, so those are the most
frequent keys. The keys below : & Q and V & Z are the most
unreachable. So if we score the keys, the bottom row is:

3 3 2 1 0 1 | 1 0 1 2 3 3

0: 2
1: 4
2: 2
3: 4

We need to use these spots to get what we care about. Some things are
important enough to always have around. Other things are okay to hide
behind one level of indirection.

Always:

Super
Control
Shift
Alt
Space
Enter
Backspace
Esc
Tab

Go into Indirect

Indirect:

Arrows
Numbers
Page Up & Down
Function keys
